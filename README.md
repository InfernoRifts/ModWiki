Mod Team Wiki — Infernorifts

This is a lightweight static wiki for the Infernorifts mod team. The Inventory Rollbacks reference has been split into its own page so it can be linked directly.

Files:
- index.html — homepage for the Mod Team Wiki (open in a browser)
- inventory.html — Inventory Rollbacks command reference (Axir)
- mod-commands.html — General Mod Commands
- styles.css — styling
- script.js — small interactions (copy to clipboard, filter)

How to open
1. In File Explorer, double-click `index.html`.
2. Or from PowerShell in this folder run:

```powershell
Start-Process "index.html"
```

Notes
- Use the Copy button on the Inventory Rollbacks page to copy a command into your clipboard before pasting into the game console.
- The search box on `inventory.html` filters commands by text.

If you'd like more sections (rollback examples, permissions, rollback logs), tell me where to add them and I'll extend the site.
